## Expressions, Variables & Constants Challenges

### Challenge 1
 Declare a constant `exercises` with value 9 and a variable `exercisesSolved` with value 0. Increment this variable every time you solve an exercise (including this one).
 */
let exercises = 9
var exercisesSolved = 0

exercisesSolved += 1
/*:
### Challenge 2
 Given the following code:
 ```swift
 age = 16
 print(age)
 age = 30
 print(age)
 ```
  Declare `age` so that it compiles.  Did you use `var` or `let`?
*/
var age = 16

/*:
### Challenge 3
 Consider the following code:

```swift
let a: Int = 46
let b: Int = 10
```
 Work out what `answer` equals when you add the following lines of code:
```swift
// 1
let answer1: Int = (a * 100) + b
// 2
let answer2: Int = (a * 100) + (b * 100)
// 3
let answer3: Int = (a * 100) + (b / 10)
```

let a: Int = 46
let b: Int = 10
// 1
let answer1: Int = (a * 100) + b //4610
// 2
let answer2: Int = (a * 100) + (b * 100) //5600
// 3
let answer3: Int = (a * 100) + (b / 10) //4601

### Challenge 6
 A temperature expressed in ¬∞C can be converted to ¬∞F by multiplying by 1.8 then incrementing by 32. In this exercise, you will do the reverse: convert a temperature from ¬∞F to ¬∞C.
 
 Declare a constant named `fahrenheit` of type `Double` and assign it a value. Calculate the corresponding temperature in ¬∞C and store the result in a constant named `celcius`.

### Challenge 7
 Suppose the squares on a chessboard are numbered left to right, top to bottom, with 0 being the top-left square and 63 being the bottom-right square. Rows are numbered top to bottom, 0 to 7. Columns are numbered left to right, 0 to 7.
 
 Declare a constant `position` and assign it a value between 0 and 63. Calculate the corresponding row and column numbers and store the results in constants named `row` and `column`.
